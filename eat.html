			 <h2>Farmhouse</h2>
			 <p>The Farmhouse offers casual all-day dining – simple, fresh and wholesome. 
			 It is a focal point at naked Stables, situated above The Big Lawn and next 
			 to The Stables; it is here that guests gravitate toward when not tucked away 
			 in their forest homes.</p>

			 <h2>Kikaboni</h2>
			 <p>With only 9 tables, kikaboni offers the fresh concept of ‘private dining 
			 in nature’. Featuring European-style cuisine with local flavours, the seasonal 
			 menu features high quality imported and locally sourced ingredients, with some 
			 produce coming from our very own naked Farm.</p>

			 <img alt="cafeteria" src="Figure/cafeteria.jpg">
			 <h2>Valley Cafeteria</h2>
			 <p>Valley Cafeteria is casual, pool-side dining. The menu features a blend of Asian 
			 and Western favourites from all over the world. Don’t restrict yourself to a 
			 table in the restaurant; a meal can be set up just about anywhere in the resort. 
			 For refreshments, there’s a bar serving beer, wine and seasonal cocktails.</p>
