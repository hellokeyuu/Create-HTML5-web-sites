			<h1>Valley Peach Story</h1>
			
			<p>Following the popularity of holiday village, a small boutique retreat, 
			   valley peach was looking to satiate the growing demand for a city
			   getaway. In the rolling hills at the foot of Moganshan was an anonymous 
			   green valley, full of peach, now known as valley peach. </p>
			<p>African and Asian elements were fused to bring the magic of African 
			   hospitality and intimacy with nature to an Asian setting. All buildings 
			   were designed to minimise the environmental impact and blend with the 
			   natural surroundings, not just with regards to materials used, but also
			    including orientation of each building. The result is an eclectic and 
			    unique mix of buildings in harmony with the natural environment.</p>

				<h2>Lay of the Land</h2>
				<p>It’s no surprise that the layout of the resort stemmed organically 
				from the existing landscape. The flat land became an impacting welcome,
				 complete with fields with grazing horses; the Tree Top Villas perch 
				 literally atop the trees; the amphitheatre sits comfortably into the 
				 slope; even the infinity pool blends in. In addition to achieving 
				 minimal landscaping, the design was to ensure minimal disturbance 
				 to the existing environment.</p>

				<h2>Local Heritage</h2>
				<p>In addition to cutting edge technology, traditional construction 
				techniques such as stonemasonry walls, bamboo and recycled timber 
				framed structures, and traditional mud wall construction were used. 
				The Earth Huts and Main Lobby were built with modern rammed earth 
				walls using compressed mud from the local area, resulting in an 
				environmentally friendly structure and striking coloured striations 
				and design.</p>

				<h2>Build by Numbers</h2>
				<p>Innovative construction technology such as prefabricated SIP 
				(structural insulated panels) was used in the construction of the Tree 
				Top Villas. This time-saving, resource-saving and environment-preserving 
				method meant that all main components – walls, floors, ceilings – were 
				made off-site, clearly labeled and assembled on-site, eradicating the 
				need for large cranes and machinery. It was literally a case of build-by-numbers.</p>
